## Python API

The mqtt-topping can be accessed by the Extension `MqttTopping`:

```py
def cb_my_callback(topic, payload):
    # code here

op.MqttTopping.Subscribe("test/hello", cb_my_callback, , qos=2, parse=True)
```

Setting `parse=False` skips parsing and the received payload remains a byte array.

Callbacks will inform over status and are identical to callbacks for mqttclient:
